# Basic DAO on Scroll Blockchain

## Introduction

Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) are a revolutionary way to govern communities and projects on the blockchain. This project involves creating a simple DAO contract on the Scroll blockchain, allowing members to join, create proposals, and vote on them.

## What is a DAO?

Imagine an organization where there’s no CEO or board of directors. Instead, everyone gets a say in decision-making. That’s a DAO. At its core, a DAO is a member-governed entity that operates on blockchain technology. It uses smart contracts to automate operations, ensuring transparency and fairness.

### How Does a DAO Work?

- **Decentralization**: In a traditional company, decisions are made by a central authority. In a DAO, there’s no central figure. Instead, every member can propose and vote on changes.
- **Autonomy**: Smart contracts are the backbone of DAOs. They handle everything from voting results to fund distribution.
- **Governance**: Members usually hold governance tokens, which grant them voting rights. The more tokens you have, the more weight your vote carries.

### Real-World Examples

- **MakerDAO**: Manages the stablecoin DAI. Members vote on protocol changes, like adjusting interest rates.
- **Aragon**: Allows users to create and manage their own DAOs, providing tools for governance and fund management.
- **Uniswap**: A decentralized exchange governed by a DAO. Token holders propose and vote on protocol changes.

## Project Goals

1. **Solidity Contract Development**: Design and implement a Solidity smart contract for a basic DAO.
2. **Scroll Sepolia Deployment**: Deploy the contract to the Scroll Sepolia testnet.
3. **GitHub Documentation**: Create a GitHub repository to host your contract code, along with a clear and comprehensive README.md file.

## Core DAO Functionality

Your DAO contract should include the following features:

### Membership:

- A function to join the DAO by paying a membership fee.
- A way to keep track of members.

### Proposal Creation:

- A function for members to create proposals with a description and voting deadline.
- Storage for proposal details.

### Voting:

- A function for members to vote on proposals (e.g., "yes" or "no").
- A mechanism to tally votes and determine if a proposal passes based on a quorum.

## Implementation Details

- **Solidity**: Use Solidity as your smart contract programming language.
- **Scroll Sepolia Testnet**: Choose the Scroll Sepolia testnet for deployment due to its lower transaction costs and testing environment.
- **GitHub**: Ensure your README.md file includes:
  - Clear instructions for compiling and deploying the contract.
  - The contract address on the Sepolia testnet.
  - A detailed explanation of the contract's functions and data structures.

## Project Checklist

### Solidity Contract:

- [x] Write the Solidity contract code for the DAO.
- [x] Thoroughly test the contract's functions locally.

### Scroll Sepolia Deployment:

- [x] Set up your development environment for Scroll.
- [x] Compile and deploy the contract to the Sepolia testnet.
- [x] Verify the contract is working correctly on the testnet.

### GitHub Repository:

- [x] Create a GitHub repository for your project.
- [x] Upload the contract code and create a README.md file.
- [x] Document the contract, deployment process, and Sepolia address in the README.md.

## Optional Enhancements (Go Beyond the Basics!)

- **Token-Based Voting**: Implement voting power based on the number of governance tokens a member holds.
- **Proposal Types**: Introduce different types of proposals (e.g., financial, rule changes).
- **Quadratic Voting**: Explore a voting mechanism that reduces the influence of large token holders.

## Contract Deployment Instructions

### Prerequisites

- **Remix IDE**: Use Remix IDE for developing and deploying your smart contract.
- **MetaMask**: Ensure you have MetaMask installed and configured to interact with the Scroll Sepolia testnet.
- **Ether**: Obtain Sepolia Ether from a faucet for gas fees.

### Steps to Deploy

1. **Open Remix IDE**: Navigate to [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).
2. **Create a New File**: Create a new file and paste your Solidity code into it.
3. **Compile the Contract**:
   - Select the appropriate compiler version.
   - Compile your Solidity code.
4. **Deploy the Contract**:
   - Go to the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab.
   - Select the Scroll Sepolia network in MetaMask.
   - Ensure your contract is selected.
   - Set the `membershipFee` (e.g., 0.001 ether) and `votingDuration` (e.g., 600 seconds).
   - Click "Deploy" and confirm the transaction in MetaMask.
5. **Interact with the Deployed Contract**:
   - After deployment, the contract will appear in the "Deployed Contracts" section.
   - Use the available functions (`join`, `createProposal`, `vote`, etc.) to interact with the contract.

### Example Transactions

- **Join DAO**: Call the `join` function with the membership fee.
- **Create Proposal**: Call the `createProposal` function with a description and voting deadline.
- **Vote on Proposal**: Call the `vote` function with the proposal ID and your vote (yes or no).

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've successfully created and deployed a basic DAO on the Scroll blockchain. This project demonstrates the power and flexibility of DAOs and provides a solid foundation for further exploration and development.
